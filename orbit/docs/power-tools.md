# Power Tools — Make Every Claude Code Session Smarter

Orbit works on vanilla tooling, but these power-ups turn it into a senior-team-grade QA station. Install everything with:

```bash
bash scripts/install-power-tools.sh
```

## Claude Code Add-Ons

### claude-mem — persistent memory across sessions

Install via Claude Code:
```
/plugin install claude-mem
```

**Why**: Every plugin audit you run becomes searchable context for the next one. "What did we fix in v2.3?" gets answered from memory instead of re-reading code.

### ccusage — token spend tracker

```bash
npm install -g ccusage
ccusage today  # see today's token spend
```

**Why**: Claude Code token cost sneaks up. ccusage shows you per-session spend so you catch runaway prompts.

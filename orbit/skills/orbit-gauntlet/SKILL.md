name: orbit-gauntlet
description: Run the full Orbit gauntlet — 11 sequential checks on a WordPress plugin (PHP lint, PHPCS, PHPStan, asset weight, i18n, Playwright, Lighthouse, DB profile, competitor compare, UI perf, AI skill audits, PM UX). Three modes — `quick` (3-5 min, dev loop), `full` (30-45 min, RC pass), `release` (45-60 min, WP.org submission). Use when the user says "run gauntlet", "audit my plugin", "full QA", "before release", or any unscoped "check my plugin" request.

# 🪐 orbit-gauntlet — The full pipeline

The flagship Orbit command. One invocation, every quality angle.

---

## Quick start

```bash
# Daily dev loop — fast feedback (~3-5 min)
bash scripts/gauntlet.sh --plugin ~/plugins/my-plugin --mode quick

# Pre-PR / beta release — everything (~30-45 min)
bash scripts/gauntlet.sh --plugin ~/plugins/my-plugin --mode full

# Day-of-release — full + WP.org plugin-check (~45-60 min)
bash scripts/gauntlet.sh --plugin ~/plugins/my-plugin --mode release
```

Exit code: **0** = release ready · **1** = blockers found.

## Reading the output

After every run:

```
reports/
├── qa-report-<timestamp>.md         ← markdown summary (start here)
├── playwright-html/index.html       ← interactive E2E report
├── skill-audits/index.html          ← tabbed AI audit (full + release only)
├── lighthouse/lh-<timestamp>.json   ← performance data
└── pm-ux/pm-ux-report-<timestamp>.html  ← PM-friendly view
```

Open the master index:
```bash
python3 scripts/generate-reports-index.py
open reports/index.html
```

## Severity triage

| Level | Action |
|---|---|
| **Critical** | Block release. Fix today. |
| **High** | Block release. Fix in this PR. |
| **Medium** | Fix if <30 min. Otherwise log. |
| **Low / Info** | Log. Defer. |

Any Critical or High in modes `full` / `release` → exit code 1.

## Common failures

### `wp-env not running on port 8881`
Site isn't up. Run `/orbit-docker-site` first.

### `phpcs: command not found`
Power tools not installed. Run `/orbit-install`.

### `Playwright tests failed — auth.setup.js`
Admin cookies expired. Re-run:
```bash
WP_TEST_URL=http://localhost:8881 npx playwright test \
  tests/playwright/auth.setup.js --project=setup
```

### `qa.config.json not found`
First-time setup needed. Run `/orbit-setup`.

### Step hangs > 10 min
Probably the AI skill audits in `--mode full` waiting on Claude Code. Check `reports/skill-audits/*.md` to see if any wrote partial output. Kill + re-run.

## What each step actually does

Detailed in `docs/04-gauntlet.md`. Quick reference:

```
Step 1   PHP Lint           → syntax errors in every .php file (~10s)
Step 1a  Release Metadata   → header, readme.txt, version parity, license, HPOS, WP compat (~20s)
Step 1b  Zip Hygiene        → dev files, forbidden functions, supply-chain audit (~30s)
Step 2   PHPCS              → WordPress + VIP coding standards (~30s)
Step 3   PHPStan            → static analysis (level 5) (~45s)
Step 4   Asset Weight       → JS/CSS bundle sizes (~5s)
Step 5   i18n / POT         → translatable strings + text domain check (~20s)
Step 6   Playwright Tests   → functional + visual regression + flow videos (~3 min)
Step 7   Lighthouse         → Core Web Vitals scores (~1 min)
Step 8   DB Profiling       → query count + slow query log + memory + cron + GDPR (~2 min)
Step 9   Competitor         → side-by-side comparison of competitor plugins (~3 min)
Step 10  UI Performance     → editor load time (Elementor/Gutenberg) + frontend TTFB (~2 min)
Step 11  Claude Skills      → 6 parallel AI audits (security, perf, DB, a11y, standards, quality)
Step 12  PM UX Audit        → spell-check + guided experience score + label benchmarking
```

## After failure — drill into a specific layer

| Layer that failed | Skill |
|---|---|
| PHPCS / WPCS | `/orbit-wp-standards` |
| Security / SAST | `/orbit-wp-security` |
| Performance | `/orbit-wp-performance` |
| Database | `/orbit-wp-database` |
| Accessibility | `/orbit-accessibility` |
| i18n | `/orbit-i18n` |
| Playwright | `/orbit-playwright` |
| Lighthouse | `/orbit-lighthouse` |
| Editor perf | `/orbit-editor-perf` |
| PM UX (spell + label) | `/orbit-pm-ux-audit` |
| WP.org plugin-check | `/orbit-plugin-check` |

Each sub-skill goes deeper than the gauntlet step.

## Variations

```bash
# Override port
WP_TEST_URL=http://localhost:8888 bash scripts/gauntlet.sh --plugin . --mode full

# Skip a specific step (debug-only — never for release)
bash scripts/gauntlet.sh --plugin . --mode full --skip 9

# Run only steps 1-5 (fast PHP-only audit)
bash scripts/gauntlet.sh --plugin . --mode quick --only 1-5

# Output JSON instead of markdown
bash scripts/gauntlet.sh --plugin . --mode full --format json
```
